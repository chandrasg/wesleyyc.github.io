+ **Deep Bi-Modal Representations to discriminate User Likes**   

A deep-bimodal representation of images is proposed based on their visual content and associated tags (text), allowing for the transfer of semantic knowledge between the two modalities. Then a model is learnt on a collection of images 'liked' by users (from Flickr), and is shown to better state-of-art by 15-20%. Beyond this test-set performance, an attempt is made to qualitatively understand the representations learned by the deep architecture used to model user `likes'.
