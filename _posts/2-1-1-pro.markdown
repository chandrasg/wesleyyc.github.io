description: |
---
Computational models show that concepts such as scenes, colors, presence of people has a positive influence on users with high scores on Openness trait. It was observed that extroverted users liked the images with the opposite sex in them and especially those with groups of people. Neurotic users were seen to like cluttered  and surreal images. The features proposed in this work to model users personality based on images they like led to a 12% improvement over the state-of-the-art.
